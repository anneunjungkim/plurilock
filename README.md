##Plurilock1 - CPSC 319 W2015

### Project

#### Behavioral Biometrics Authentication on Mobile Devices

#### Overview

The purpose of the application is to continuously record touch data from a touchscreen for the purpose of authenticating biometrically the user based on their usage pattern. This raw input is readily available through the phoneâ€™s API. The collected data is sent to the server for processing and authentication decision-making. The project will focus only on implementing the client application. 

### Motivation

This project is created for the Plurilock team in Victoria, BC by members of CPSC 319 Group 1 at the University of British Columbia. The purpose of the project is to retrieve detailed touch data on a client device and send it to the Plurilock server for user authentication. A mock banking app will be produced for the purposes of demonstrating this technology on the Android operating system.
